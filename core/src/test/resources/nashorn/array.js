// 数组转换
// 下面的代码将Java的List转换为JavaScript原生数组：
var javaList = new java.util.ArrayList();
javaList.add("1");
javaList.add("2");
javaList.add("3");
var jsArray = Java.from(javaList);

print(Object.prototype.toString.call(jsArray));  // [object Array]

// 下面的代码执行相反操作：
var javaArray = Java.to([3, 5, 7, 11], "int[]");
